3. Description
Going Home is a resource-based game about navigating a ship back home. Along the way you'll encounter tentacle monsters that attack and damage your ship. You must carefully manage your solar energy to power your different ship components, enabling your weapons and defences to fight the seas.

4. How to Play
Use the mouse to click on your different ship components to power or depower them:
Flashlight - Light your way home
Engine - Progresses ship forward
Shield - Reduce damage
Health - Regenerate overall health
Cannon - Fire at enemies

Make sure your overall health stays above zero, and watch out for your power meter that drains from using components. Wait for day time to regenerate power.
